    # Ignore all pnpm catalog-managed dependencies.
    # Dependabot corrupts catalog: specifiers in pnpm-lock.yaml,
    # replacing them with exact versions, which breaks --frozen-lockfile.
    # Upstream bugs:
    #   https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/12445
    #   https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/12244
    # These dependencies are managed via pnpm-workspace.yaml catalog.
    # TODO: remove ignore rules when the upstream bug is fixed.
