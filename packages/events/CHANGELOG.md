# @connectum/events

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#140](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/140) [`cd03cb3`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/cd03cb35d66cc5109fc0853089ab659d30c73ccd) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Remove `PublishOptions.sync`.

  The flag was a no-op: every adapter already confirms publishes per-message
  (NATS `PubAck`, Kafka `producer.send`, Redis `XADD`, AMQP per-message broker
  ack with typed errors on nack/return/timeout). A resolved `publish()` already
  means the broker accepted the message — there was no fire-and-forget mode to
  opt out of. Removed ahead of the first stable release; drop `sync` from any
  `publish()` calls (no behavior change).

- [#129](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/129) [`4cef99b`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/4cef99b469f7399993319a436fa11fd4747ffd2f) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - chore: raise minimum supported Node.js to 22.13.0

  The `engines.node` requirement for all packages is raised from `>=20.0.0` to
  `>=22.13.0`. Node.js 20 reached end-of-life on 2026-04-30 and no longer receives
  security updates.

  Node.js 22 is the current LTS line. Consumers on Node.js 20 or earlier must
  upgrade to Node.js 22.13.0 or later. Packages continue to ship compiled
  JavaScript, so no build-step changes are required on the consumer side.

  Marked as a major change because raising the runtime floor is breaking for
  consumers on Node.js 20; it lands in the upcoming 1.0.0 baseline.

### Minor Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/63) [`4d48e1c`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/4d48e1c8ef9877fbc572a421bb99c0704f9fbbca) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - feat: auto-derive broker client identity from proto service names

  EventBus now automatically derives a service identifier from registered proto
  service descriptors (`DescService.typeName`) and passes it to adapters via
  the new `AdapterContext` parameter in `connect()`.

  Format: `{packageNames}@{hostname}` (e.g., `order.v1@pod-abc123`).

  **Adapter behavior** (when no explicit client ID is configured):

  - **Kafka**: uses `serviceName` as `clientId` (visible in broker logs, JMX, ACLs)
  - **NATS**: uses `serviceName` as connection `name` (visible in `/connz`)
  - **Redis**: uses `serviceName` as `connectionName` (visible in `CLIENT LIST`)

  Explicit adapter options (`clientId`, `connectionOptions.name`,
  `redisOptions.connectionName`) always take priority over the derived name.

- [#45](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/45) [`25992b4`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/25992b4d8beaf6921b9497536cc758b5144d1a7c) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Add EventBus provider with pluggable broker adapters (NATS JetStream, Kafka/Redpanda, Redis Streams).

  **New packages:**

  - `@connectum/events` — Universal event adapter layer with proto-first pub/sub, middleware pipeline, DLQ
  - `@connectum/events-nats` — NATS JetStream adapter with durable consumers
  - `@connectum/events-kafka` — Kafka/Redpanda adapter with consumer groups
  - `@connectum/events-redis` — Redis Streams adapter with XREADGROUP

  **Core integration:**

  - `EventBusLike` interface for server lifecycle integration
  - `createServer({ eventBus })` option with automatic start/stop management

- [#91](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/91) [`7f23c41`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/7f23c4120680a57e084a03de0a6da978c31b65f4) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - feat(events): support per-handler middleware configuration

  Event handlers registered via `router.service()` can now specify per-handler
  middleware that overrides the global EventBus middleware pipeline.

  Handlers support two forms:

  - Simple function: `onEvent: async (msg, ctx) => { ... }` (uses global middleware)
  - Config object: `onEvent: { handler: async (msg, ctx) => { ... }, middleware: [...] }` (per-handler override)

  Closes [#49](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/issues/49)

- [#91](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/91) [`7f23c41`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/7f23c4120680a57e084a03de0a6da978c31b65f4) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - feat(events): auto-resolve publish topic from proto annotations

  EventBus.publish() now automatically resolves the topic from proto
  `(connectum.events.v1.event).topic` option when no explicit topic is
  provided in PublishOptions. This eliminates the need to manually
  duplicate topic strings between proto definitions and publish calls.

  Priority order:

  1. Explicit `publishOptions.topic` (override)
  2. Proto annotation topic (auto-resolved from registered routes)
  3. `schema.typeName` (fallback, backward compatible)

  **New test files:**

  - `core/envSchema.test.ts` — env config validation (50 tests)
  - `core/server-lifecycle.test.ts` — server integration with eventBus, protocols, shutdown (24 tests)
  - `auth/errors.test.ts` — AuthzDeniedError (14 tests)
  - `auth/authz-utils.test.ts` — satisfiesRequirements() (12 tests)
  - `cli/proto-sync.test.ts` — CLI unit tests (33 tests, was 4 integration-only)
  - `events/topic.test.ts` — resolveTopicName() (3 tests)
  - `healthcheck/healthcheck-grpc.test.ts` — gRPC Health Check + HTTP E2E (11 tests)

  **Extended existing tests:**

  - `core` — Server state transitions, ShutdownManager deps/cycles, graceful shutdown edge cases (+17)
  - `healthcheck` — gRPC handlers, manager merge, HTTP handler scenarios (+17)
  - `reflection` — circular deps, empty registry, multiple services (+6)
  - `interceptors` — error handler, timeout, retry, bulkhead, fallback, defaults (+20)
  - `events-nats/kafka/amqp` — adapter utility functions (+15)

- [#151](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/151) [`a839d37`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/a839d3700e76a83e243f5a7154991c72add266b4) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - chore(deps): bump in-range production dependencies

  Raise the lower bounds of catalog-managed production dependencies within their
  existing `^` ranges (minor/patch, no breaking changes). On publish, pnpm rewrites
  each `catalog:` specifier to the concrete range, so raising the floor changes the
  dependency contract surfaced to consumers — hence a patch bump.

  - `@connectrpc/connect` `^2.1.1 → ^2.1.2`
  - `@connectrpc/connect-node` `^2.1.1 → ^2.1.2`
  - `@bufbuild/protobuf` `^2.11.0 → ^2.12.0`
  - `zod` `^4.3.6 → ^4.4.3`

  Affected packages (production `dependencies` referencing the above via `catalog:`):
  auth, cli, core, events, healthcheck, interceptors, otel, reflection,
  test-fixtures, testing. Build, typecheck, lint, unit/integration tests, the
  Bun/esbuild cross-runtime suites, and the HTTP ↔ in-process parity gate all pass
  with no behavioural changes (including ConnectRPC cancellation and unary-GET
  query handling paths).

  Dev-only tooling bumps in the same change (not part of the published dependency
  contract, so no version impact): `@biomejs/biome`, `@bufbuild/buf`,
  `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es`, `@bufbuild/protovalidate`, `tsup`, `@types/node`.

- [#91](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/91) [`7f23c41`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/7f23c4120680a57e084a03de0a6da978c31b65f4) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - fix(events): preserve concrete input types in ServiceEventHandlers

  Changed `ServiceEventHandlers` mapped type to derive handler input types from
  `S["method"]` (concrete GenService record) instead of `S["methods"][number]`
  (generic DescMethod array). This preserves concrete protobuf message types
  in event handlers, eliminating the need for `as unknown as T` casts.

  Closes [#86](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/issues/86)

- [#67](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/67) [`d42e2bd`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/d42e2bdc7229635214abc63553b39d9dee8985b2) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Fix composeMiddleware to support retry middleware

  The handler branch (dispatch terminal case) was outside the try/catch
  block, so handler errors did not reset the dispatch index. This caused
  retry middleware to hit the "next() called multiple times" guard on
  subsequent attempts instead of actually retrying.

  Moved handler into try/catch and added await for proper error propagation.

- [#159](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/159) [`66164ac`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/66164acd3709fd1e1ec61ab12142b46e5dedb9bb) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - fix: preserve the `node:` protocol prefix on builtin imports

  tsup strips the `node:` prefix from builtin imports by default (`removeNodeProtocol: true`). The bare forms (`crypto`, `fs`, `http2`, …) are valid Node aliases, but the `node:` prefix is the portable specifier across runtimes — Deno resolves builtins prefix-first (bare forms are not guaranteed), and prefix-only builtins like `node:test` have no bare alias at all. Every package now sets `removeNodeProtocol: false`, so the published artifacts keep the prefix on every builtin import for maximum cross-runtime portability (Node / Bun / Deno). No runtime behavior change on Node. (`@connectum/testing` already carried this fix.)
