# @connectum/testing

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#129](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/129) [`4cef99b`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/4cef99b469f7399993319a436fa11fd4747ffd2f) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - chore: raise minimum supported Node.js to 22.13.0

  The `engines.node` requirement for all packages is raised from `>=20.0.0` to
  `>=22.13.0`. Node.js 20 reached end-of-life on 2026-04-30 and no longer receives
  security updates.

  Node.js 22 is the current LTS line. Consumers on Node.js 20 or earlier must
  upgrade to Node.js 22.13.0 or later. Packages continue to ship compiled
  JavaScript, so no build-step changes are required on the consumer side.

  Marked as a major change because raising the runtime floor is breaking for
  consumers on Node.js 20; it lands in the upcoming 1.0.0 baseline.

### Minor Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/24) [`bb40d53`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/bb40d5340dcc2a208eb69a34eb5e22f38068a667) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Migrate to compile-before-publish with tsup (ADR-001 revision).

  All packages now publish compiled .js + .d.ts + source maps instead of raw .ts source.
  Consumer Node.js requirement lowered from >=25.2.0 to >=18.0.0.

  REMOVED: `@connectum/core/register` — no longer needed, packages ship compiled JS.

- [#117](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/117) [`0f98dfa`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/0f98dfa5f77c37fa995c4b63b7bd5c3f613f2d3e) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Add in-process transport with automatic local/remote routing via service registry.

  **`@connectum/core`** — new public API for in-process service invocation:

  - `createLocalTransport(server, options?)` — ConnectRPC `Transport` bound to the server's router; supports client-side interceptors.
  - `server.client(service, options?)` — auto-routing client factory: in-process if `service` is registered on this server, else `options.fallback`, else fail-fast `ConnectError(unimplemented)`.
  - `server.localClient(service)` — low-level helper that always returns an in-process client.
  - `server.hasService(desc)` — synchronous service registry lookup by `desc.typeName`.

  The in-process transport runs the full server-side interceptor chain (validation, authorization, OpenTelemetry), supports unary and all streaming RPCs, propagates `Headers` and `AbortSignal`, and preserves 1-to-1 behavioural parity with the HTTP/gRPC transport. Strictly additive — no breaking changes.

  **`@connectum/testing`** — helpers for cross-transport testing:

  - `createLocalClient(server, service)` — concise client for unit and integration tests without binding ports.
  - `transportParityTest(name, scenario)` — driver that runs one declarative scenario against both `createGrpcTransport` and `createLocalTransport`, structurally diffs the observable outcome (response, headers, `ConnectError`, OTEL spans, metrics), and fails on any divergence.
  - In-memory OTEL `SpanExporter` and `MetricReader` collectors used by the parity driver.

  **`@connectum/otel`** — observability parity for the in-process path:

  - `connectum.transport` span attribute (`in-process` | `http`) on both CLIENT and SERVER spans.
  - `transport` metric label on `rpc.client.duration`, `rpc.server.duration`, payload size, and error counter instruments.
  - W3C Trace Context (`traceparent` / `tracestate`) propagation through in-memory `Headers` so server spans are children of client spans on both transports.

- [#117](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/117) [`0f98dfa`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/0f98dfa5f77c37fa995c4b63b7bd5c3f613f2d3e) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Extract mock factories, assertion helpers, and protobuf descriptor fixtures
  from `@connectum/testing` into a new transport-free package
  `@connectum/test-fixtures`.

  **Why**: `@connectum/interceptors` depended on `@connectum/testing` in
  devDependencies for its unit tests (via `assertConnectError`, `createMockNext*`,
  `createMockRequest`), while `@connectum/testing` depended on
  `@connectum/interceptors` for parity tests — creating a workspace build cycle
  that broke `turbo build` and forced `pack-all.sh` to fall back to
  `pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=1`.

  **What moved** (from `@connectum/testing` → `@connectum/test-fixtures`):

  - `assertConnectError`
  - `createMockFn`, `MockCall`, `MockFn`
  - `createMockRequest`, `createMockNext`, `createMockNextError`, `createMockNextSlow`
  - `createMockStream`
  - `createMockDescMessage`, `createMockDescField`, `createMockDescMethod`
  - `createFakeService`, `createFakeMethod`
  - All mock/fixture option types (`MockRequestOptions`, `MockNextOptions`, etc.)

  **Backwards compatible**: all the above symbols are re-exported from
  `@connectum/testing` so existing imports continue to work unchanged. The
  parity driver, in-process transport helper, test server, and OTel collectors
  remain in `@connectum/testing`.

  **Internal**: `@connectum/interceptors` now depends on
  `@connectum/test-fixtures` in devDependencies instead of `@connectum/testing`.
  Its public API is unchanged.

  - **`mockResolver(mocks)` / `mockService(service, impl)`** — a `RemoteResolver`
    that serves canned implementations in-process; every response is tagged with
    `x-connectum-mock: true` (`MOCK_RESPONSE_HEADER`) so tests can prove a call was
    mock-served. Returns `null` for unmocked services, so it composes with real
    resolvers.
  - **`createMockContext({ catalog, mocks, ... })`** — build a Connectum `Context`
    for unit-testing a handler's `ctx.call` / `ctx.stream` in isolation. It drives
    the SAME catalog dispatch path as a live request (resolver lookup, cascade,
    interceptors, error semantics), so there is no parallel mock path to drift
    from.

- [#41](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/41) [`fccee26`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/fccee264ec7ed685348a7590057ec8316f21ef1a) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - Implement @connectum/testing utilities package with 13 factory functions for ConnectRPC testing.

  **Phase 1 (P0)**: `createMockRequest`, `createMockNext`, `createMockNextError`, `createMockNextSlow`, `assertConnectError`
  **Phase 2 (P1)**: `createMockDescMessage`, `createMockDescField`, `createMockDescMethod`, `createMockStream`, `createFakeService`, `createFakeMethod`
  **Phase 3 (P2)**: `createTestServer`, `withTestServer`

  Eliminates 135+ test boilerplate duplicates across interceptors, auth, otel, and core packages. All migrated packages now use shared testing utilities instead of inline mock objects.

### Patch Changes

- [#151](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/pull/151) [`a839d37`](https://github.com/Connectum-Framework/connectum/commit/a839d3700e76a83e243f5a7154991c72add266b4) Thanks [@intech](https://github.com/intech)! - chore(deps): bump in-range production dependencies

  Raise the lower bounds of catalog-managed production dependencies within their
  existing `^` ranges (minor/patch, no breaking changes). On publish, pnpm rewrites
  each `catalog:` specifier to the concrete range, so raising the floor changes the
  dependency contract surfaced to consumers — hence a patch bump.

  - `@connectrpc/connect` `^2.1.1 → ^2.1.2`
  - `@connectrpc/connect-node` `^2.1.1 → ^2.1.2`
  - `@bufbuild/protobuf` `^2.11.0 → ^2.12.0`
  - `zod` `^4.3.6 → ^4.4.3`

  Affected packages (production `dependencies` referencing the above via `catalog:`):
  auth, cli, core, events, healthcheck, interceptors, otel, reflection,
  test-fixtures, testing. Build, typecheck, lint, unit/integration tests, the
  Bun/esbuild cross-runtime suites, and the HTTP ↔ in-process parity gate all pass
  with no behavioural changes (including ConnectRPC cancellation and unary-GET
  query handling paths).

  Dev-only tooling bumps in the same change (not part of the published dependency
  contract, so no version impact): `@biomejs/biome`, `@bufbuild/buf`,
  `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es`, `@bufbuild/protovalidate`, `tsup`, `@types/node`.

  tsup strips the `node:` prefix from builtin imports by default (`removeNodeProtocol: true`). For `node:test` that is fatal — the unprefixed `test` has no bare builtin equivalent, so the published `dist/parity.js` shipped `import { test } from "test"` and threw `Cannot find package 'test'` in every consumer of the `./parity` subpath. Setting `removeNodeProtocol: false` keeps `node:test` (and other builtins) intact; the consumer floor is Node >=22.13 where the prefix is required for `node:test` and supported for every builtin.

  Replaced `mock.fn()` from `node:test` with a portable `createMockFn()`
  implementation that works across Node.js, Bun, and bundler environments.
  The public API surface (`.mock.calls`, `.mock.callCount()`) is preserved.

  This unblocks Bun users from using `@connectum/testing` utilities.
