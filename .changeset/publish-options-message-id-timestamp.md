Add `PublishOptions.messageId` and `PublishOptions.timestamp` (Unix epoch seconds) so a caller can set the message identity an external contract requires. Adapters honor them where supported and ignore them otherwise; `@connectum/events-amqp` maps them to the AMQP `messageId` / `timestamp` properties.

This completes the external-contract publish path (#161): in `externalContract` mode the adapter auto-generates nothing, so a caller-supplied `messageId` / `timestamp` is the way to populate those wire properties when the contract demands them. A supplied value is used as-is in any mode; auto-generation still applies only in non-external mode when the caller omits them.
